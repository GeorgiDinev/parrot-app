# parrot-app

I have a very annoying parrot which screams almost all day and drives my family crazy. That’s why I decided to develop this app with the hope to  make him be more quiet :)

If he screams continuously this app will detect it. After that the curtain will roll down and it will cover the parrot’s cage and a calming music will be played on my mobile phone. After several minutes the curtain will rise up and everything will be back to normal.

A showcase of the result:</br>

This project consists of several components:
* Raspberry PI zero with Python service for classification of audio sounds
* Step motor
* Mobile Phone which sends the realtime recorded audio to the PI zero and plays calming sounds if the bird is screaming
* Curtain mechanism
