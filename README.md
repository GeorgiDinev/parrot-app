# parrot-app

I have a very annoying parrot which screams almost all day and drives my family crazy. That’s why I decided to develop this app with the hope to  make him more quiet :)

If he screams continuously a curtain will drop down and it will cover the parrot’s cage and a calming music will be played on my mobile phone. After several minutes the curtain will rise up and everything will be back to normal.

A showcase of the result:
